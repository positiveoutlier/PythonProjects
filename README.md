# Python_projects

Some scripts I created while doing the Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python, provided by MIT.
The course description and contents can be found at [MIT's website](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/) and is also offered through [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0).
Some of the topics covered are:
* The Python programming language (Python 3.5)
* Some simple algorithms
* Testing and debugging
* An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
* Data structures

Students are encouraged to write scripts at their own computer, debugging and testing them out before submitting them, 
hence the scripts that are collected here.
